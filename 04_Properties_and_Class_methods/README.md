# Summary

## Class Attributes vs. Static Attributes

* EXPLICIT IS BETTER THAN IMPLICIT.

### Class Attributes

* Class attributes are defined on the class outside the __init__ function.

* Classes don't introduce new scopes. Class attributes are referred by their class names.

* There are only four scopes referred to as LEGB: Local, Enclosing Functions, Global and Built-in.

* Class attributes are attributes that are available across all instances of the class.

* Class attributes can be accessed directly from the class as well as from the instances of the class.

* But attempting to assign to a class attribute with the self reference (example: self.attr = 23), will create a new instance attribute instead and the class attribute will remain unmodified.

### Static methods

* Static methods are defined on the class object.

* To declare a method static, use the @staticmethod decorator.

* We can also define something called a class method with the @classmethod decorator which takes cls as its first argument, which is simply a reference to the class object.

* Implementation details of a class method (functions inside class) should always start with an _

* Static methods in Python have no knowledge of the class within which they are defined.

### Choosing between class method and static method

* We should use @classmethod when we need to access the class object in order to use class methods or the constructor.

* Static methods are used when no access to class or instance objects are required.
  They are most likely an implementation detail of the class.
  The @staticmethod decorator merely facilitates a logical organisation of code allowing us to put inside classes what would otherwise be free functions.

* Static method names should start with an _

* Named Constructors or Factory Functions: Functions within class which construct objects with certain configurations.

* Static methods and Inheritance: Static methods in Python can be overridden in sub-classes (Inheritance). For polymorphic dispatch of static method invocation, call through the self instance.

* Class methods and Inheritance: Class methods behave polymorphically as a distinguished feature of Python

* To extend super class constructor inside derived class's constructor, use super(). __init__()

* Private properties of a class are named starting with an _

* The @property decorator can be used to transform getter methods so that they can be called as if they were attributes.
